This component is a styled `<a>` element that contains the same styling as `AnchorButton` (which is a styled `<button>`)

```jsx
<Link href="http://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank">External Link</Link>
```

Default styling:

```jsx
<div>
  Apparently we had reached a great height in the <Link href="http://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank">atmosphere</Link>, for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same <Link href="http://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank">illusion which lifts the horizon</Link> of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an <Link href="http://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank">immense dark sphere</Link>, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a <Link href="http://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank">ruddy light streaming</Link> through a rift in the clouds.
</div>
```
