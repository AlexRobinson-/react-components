These guidelines are based on our experience writing help documentation for the [Shopify Help Center](#test). They’re all intended to serve the same goal: to educate and empower Shopify merchants.

To include a link to help documentation in your app or channel, use the Footer help component.

## Plan for your audience

The way you write your help documentation should change depending on the type of audience and their expectations. Take some time to plan for your audience.

### Audience Types

Write help documentation for its intended audience. For any given document, we can expect a wide spectrum of Shopify users as an audience:

#### Prospective users

* Not signed up yet, possibly on a free trial

#### Novice users

* Signed up but might not have sold online before
* Possibly not very computer-literate
* New to Shopify concepts and workflows

#### Experienced, confident users

* Have been using Shopify for some time
* Familiar with the basic concepts and workflows
* Confident with computers
* Able to try some customizations with guidance

#### Highly technical users

* Experienced and confident
* Extensive computing experience
* Happy to experiment and take risks
* Experienced problem-solvers
* Self serve through forums and help documentation

### AUDIENCE EXPECTATIONS

Each of these different users will likely have different expectations for the same document. Let’s take a look at how that might play out:

#### Prospective users

* A quick-start guide
* Conceptual overviews

#### Novice users

* Lots of hand-holding
* Clear step-by-step instructions
* Conceptual overviews
* Definitions of terms
* Tutorials
* Context-sensitive help

#### Experienced, confident users

* Clear step-by-step instructions
* Conceptual overviews
* Definitions of terms
* More challenging tutorials
* Context-sensitive help

#### Highly technical users

* Procedural instructions (can be to-the-point)
* Code fragments
* Pointers to information sources

This is just one way to imagine the variety of users that fit into our audience. However we imagine their skill level, our aim for documentation remains the same: to accommodate a wide range of users and their objectives. We can do this by presenting information in a way that’s inclusive of different skill levels, different learning styles, and different workflows.

## Use headings to organize your document

Readers come to help documentation with different expectations and in different usage settings. For example:

* One might be working through a long, multi-stage setup process to connect a third-party app into her admin
* Another might be using her tablet to check out the details of Shopify POS and see if it could be used at her cafe
* Another might be trying to make a quick edit to his storefront in the half hour he has left before going to pick up his kids from school

In all these different cases, the reader needs documentation that’s findable, usable, and relevant—in short, organized.
