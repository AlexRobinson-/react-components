## What is voice and tone?

Shopify’s voice is a reflection of who we are. We should always sound like Shopify. Our tone adapts appropriately to the context and situation. The best way to decide what tone to use is to ask yourself what merchants are likely feeling when they encounter your message so you can decide how to respond.

For example, when merchants make a sale for the first time, they might be feeling excited, accomplished, and maybe a little bit unsure of what to do next. We can respond to this by congratulating them and giving them the information they need to process their order.

When merchants encounter an error message, they might be feeling anxious, stressed out, and worried about the impact it could have on their business. We can respond to this by stating what went wrong and giving clear direction about how to fix the problem. We never want to use a negative or frightening tone.

## Voice guidelines

Shopify is always:

### Confident, not arrogant

* Use expertise to help merchants succeed, don’t talk down to them
* Be plain-spoken, not pretentious
* Be specific when explaining a merchant benefit without making a feature sound better than it is

### Empathetic, not overprotective

* Communicate in a way that respects merchant emotions and situations
* Offer merchants encouragement and practical advice
* Clearly explain how merchants will be impacted when something goes wrong, but don’t over-explain with redundant content
