Learn how to apply Shopify’s voice and choose the right tone, no matter
what product, feature, or app you’re building.

### What is voice and tone

Shopify’s voice is a reflection of who we are. We should always sound like
Shopify. Our tone adapts appropriately to the context and situation. The
best way to decide what tone to use is to ask yourself what merchants are
likely feeling when they encounter your message so you can decide how to respond.

For example, when merchants make a sale for the first time, they might be
feeling excited, accomplished, and maybe a little bit unsure of what to do
next. We can respond to this by congratulating them and giving them the
information they need to process their order.

When merchants encounter an error message, they might be feeling anxious,
stressed out, and worried about the impact it could have on their business.
We can respond to this by stating what went wrong and giving clear direction
about how to fix the problem. We never want to use a negative or frightening tone.

### Voice guidelines

Shopify is always:

#### CONFIDENT, NOT ARROGANT

- Use expertise to help merchants succeed, don’t talk down to them
- Be plain-spoken, not pretentious
- Be specific when explaining a merchant benefit without making a feature
  sound better than it is

#### EMPATHETIC, NOT OVERPROTECTIVE

- Communicate in a way that respects merchant emotions and situations
- Offer merchants encouragement and practical advice
- Clearly explain how merchants will be impacted when something goes wrong,
  but don’t over-explain with redundant content

#### TRANSPARENT, NOT BLUNT

- Be upfront and honest with merchants, even if we make a mistake
- Back up claims with facts and data
- Communicate with clarity and empathy—be direct, not insensitive

### Tone in action

Here are some examples of how Shopify’s tone changes depending on the context.
Positive, neutral, or negative situations will change the tone of our message.
