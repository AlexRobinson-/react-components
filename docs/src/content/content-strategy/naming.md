title: Naming
---

The names we give our products and features teach merchants how to use
Shopify and how to find the things they need to run their business.

## Thoughtful naming

Names influence how merchants and other audiences perceive and understand
Shopify. A well-chosen name will:

- Put clarity above creativity
- Help establish a mental model for our audiences
- Enhance people’s perception of our brand
- Increase adoption of the product or feature
- Differentiate Shopify from other products
- Clarify where a product or feature fits into our brand system

The naming process involves collaboration. Include different disciplines
and people with different subject matter expertise in the creation of a name.

### Test another one

## Does it need a branded name

Most features don’t need an official, branded name. For example, order entry
is a feature that’s referred to descriptively and so doesn’t need to be
capitalized. When choosing what to call a feature, pick words that describe
what the feature does or represents. If there’s room, add extra context for
merchants by describing the feature instead of using only the feature name.

Avoid capitalizing descriptive feature names.

If there‘s room, describe the feature instead of defaulting to only using
the name.

## USING “SHOPIFY”

Only Shopify can use the word “Shopify” in a name. The word “Shopify” can’t be
used to name third-party products.

It’s important we use the word “Shopify” consistently, and sparingly. Don’t use
“Shopify” in a name unless there’s a lack of surrounding context and we want its
target audience to know it’s associated with Shopify.

Adding “Shopify” doesn’t add clarity in the context of other Shopify products and
features. For example, merchants often confuse Shopify Shipping with the other
shipping features, like shipping settings, carrier calculated shipping rates,
shipping labels, and shipping zones. Our support staff have to refer to the
Shopify Plan by its cost because the general name doesn’t distinguish it from
the other plans.

Use “Shopify” in front of a name when a product:

- Is or will become a separate product or platform and we need to associate
  it with Shopify
- Should be differentiated from other, similar products in the industry
- Doesn’t justify an evocative name, but still needs to associated with Shopify

Don’t use “Shopify” in a name for built in functionality features, like
fraud analysis or importing products.

Avoid jargon and give merchants a hint about the actions they’ll be able
to take when they interact with the product or feature.

## EVOCATIVE NAMES

Standalone products use evocative names to position us in the industry.
These unique and bold naming conventions can help with branding or recall,
but don’t always help people understand the experience. They’re better
for standalone products, and not for experiences that are part of Shopify’s
main product offering.

Sometimes Shopify acquires a product or service that already has a unique,
branded name. Even though it may become more tied to Shopify, it can keep
its name to maintain its brand identity. This also helps maintain the context
audiences already have about the product, like in the case of Kit.

Certain standalone names use the word “Shopify” because it differentiates
the product from similar ones in the industry, like Shopify Pay in
comparison to Apple Pay, or Android Pay. For more details, see the
guidelines for using “Shopify” in a name.

Evocative names should:

- Have a strong, independent brand identity
- Help with branding or recall
- Reflect the concept it represents
- Make sense when used in marketing materials

If you work at Shopify and want to trademark a name, talk to the legal
department. It’s easier to trademark unique or made-up name. These names
have stronger identities, but it’s not always clear what they do.

Some evocative names can be more descriptive, although they’re harder to
trademark if they use common terminology. Not all evocative names need
to be trademarked.

If you’re creating a website or product for an existing brand, maintain
its brand identity and keep “Shopify” out of the name.

## Shopify products and features

An off-brand and unclear name can confuse your audience. It can also
feel disconnected from the rest of Shopify.

A good product or feature name should:

- Help merchants understand what the experience represents
- Fit into the information architecture of the product or website in
  which it belongs
- Make sense when compared to other products, features, websites, or
  events in the same market
- Avoid any negative or weird connotations

There are two types of approaches to naming, the descriptive approach,
or the evocative approach.

## REFERRING TO SHOPIFY AND AREAS IN THE ADMIN

Use consistent and easy to understand descriptions when referring to
locations in product, especially in help documentation. Descriptive feature
names aren’t capitalized, but when providing steps in a workflow, it’s
okay to capitalize the page name, for example, “Go to the Products page”.
Note that the page name is capitalized, but “page” isn’t.

When referring to Shopify’s main product offering, use “Shopify”. The only
exception is when you need to differentiate it from another product, like
the mobile app, or explain a task specific to the admin. In these cases,
you can use “Shopify admin”.

A good description can:

- Increase adoption of the product area
- Help establish a mental model for merchants
- Clarify where the area fits into the product system
- Help support staff and merchants understand each other when communicating

A good description should:

- Avoid jargon
- Be used consistently
- Describe the area it represents
- Prioritize terminology used by merchants over industry standards

Use consistent descriptions when referring to areas in the Shopify admin.

Merchants call our main product offering “Shopify”, so we use that same terminology.

Top-level marketing content is created for audiences who have little
context about Shopify. Since they may not know about specific Shopify
products, we use “Shopify” here too.
